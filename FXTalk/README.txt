- This distro contains customized version of Smack V3.2.2 library.
- Modify the shell scripts and windows script files in the package/** to suit to your machine needs(like JDK could be different etc)
- If you edit FXTalk-post-image.sh script in Windows there is high probability that it will cause weird failures and errors(due to \n \r characters), just recreate it on Mac OSX and redo it.
- Do not forget to change the info.plist for jdk.
